this is AppLaunch v0.1!

this app will launch a set of apps that you choose every time you hit the keybind Ctrl+Win+Alt

to change the apps, edit the apps.txt file

you can only open apps that are found on the apps list on the start menu

try to write the entire app name that you see in the start menu to be sure it will launch that and not something else

each app should be in a different line

add a shortcut of AppLauncher.exe on %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup for the program to automatically start on Startup

add a shortcut of any app that is not on the start menu on %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs for AppLauncher to be able to open them
